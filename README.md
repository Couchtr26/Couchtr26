Hi, I'm Thomas 👋
Builder. Coder. Relentless Creator.

I don’t just write code — I ship tools people can actually use.

🛠️ What Drives Me
I don’t code to learn — I code to build. Every project I release is something that makes someone say,
“Holy hell, I can use this.”
If it doesn’t, it’s not done yet.

From QR flyer generators to emotional companions, file sorters to dev utilities — if it doesn’t exist, I’ll build it.

💻 Projects You’ll Actually Use
Spectral Hacker
Educational spectroscopy tool in Python.
Extracts basic gas compositions from space/star images by analyzing RGB spectra — perfect for hobbyists, students, educators, and science fans.

Movie Sorter
Sort your movie collection by title using metadata.
Because files named MOVIE_FINAL2_FIXED.mkv deserve better.

Bookmark-Cleaner
JavaScript tool that scans exported bookmark HTML files for dead or unreachable links.
Fully client-side, privacy-focused, and super easy to use.

Bankline-Billiards
Lightweight digital pool game prototype built with Python and Pygame.
Features realistic physics, AI opponents, and trick shot saving for solo fun.
