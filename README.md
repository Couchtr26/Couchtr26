# 👋 Hey, I'm Thomas

### Builder. Coder. Relentless Creator.

I don’t just write code — I ship tools people can *actually use*.  
> 🛠️ I don’t code to learn — I code to **build**.  
> Every project I release is something that makes someone say,  
> **“Holy hell, I can use this.”** If it doesn’t, it isn’t done yet.

From QR flyer generators to emotional companions, file sorters to dev utilities —  
if it doesn’t exist yet, I’ll build it.
