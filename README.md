Thomas Couch 👋
Builder. Coder. Relentless Creator.
I don’t just write code — I deliver tools people can actually use. Every project I release solves real problems and provides clear value. If it’s not ready to help someone, it’s not done yet.

🛠️ Core Focus
Rails & Web Apps: From full-stack applications to REST APIs.
Automation & Scripting: Python and JavaScript tools for real-world productivity.
Rapid Prototyping: Fast idea-to-release execution without cutting corners.
