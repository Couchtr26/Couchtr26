# 👋 Hey, I'm Thomas

**Builder. Coder. Relentless creator.**  
I don’t just write code — I ship tools people can *actually use*.  
> 🛠️ I don’t just code to learn — I code to build.  
> Every project I release is something you can actually use.  
> If it doesn’t make someone say “Holy hell, I can use this,” it isn’t done yet.

From QR flyer generators to emotional companions, from file sorters to dev utilities — if it doesn’t exist yet, I’ll build it.

## 💻 Projects You’ll Actually Use

### 🚀 [ScanShow](https://github.com/YourUsername/ScanShow)
QR Code flyer builder – clean designs, optional product images, logo uploads, and layout templates. Built for real businesses, not fake demos.

### 🎥 [Movie Sorter](https://github.com/YourUsername/MovieSorter)
Sort your movie collection by title using metadata. Because files named `MOVIE_FINAL2_FIXED.mkv` deserve better.

### 🤖 [Silas](https://github.com/YourUsername/Silas)
An emotional support tool in development. Silas is built to *feel good*, not just look good — and the journey is just getting started.

## 🛠️ What I Do

- Python Developer (real-world tools, not textbook fluff)
- GUI apps using Tkinter & Flask
- File automation & data parsing
- Idea > Execution > Release — **fast**

## 🧠 Why I'm Here

I’m not here for stars.  
I’m here to build — and help people who **actually do things**.

You want slick drag-and-drop for your pitch deck?  
Cool.  
You want *code that works, fast, and clean*?

We should talk.

“Let’s build it instead of whining it doesn’t exist” —  
We’re already on the same page.
