Hi, I'm Thomas 👋
Builder. Coder. Relentless Creator.

I don’t just write code — I deliver tools people can actually use.

🛠️ What Drives Me
I don’t code to learn — I code to build. Every project I release aims to solve real problems and deliver clear value. If it’s not ready to help someone, it’s not done yet.

From QR flyer generators to emotional companions, file sorters to developer utilities — if it doesn’t exist, I’ll build it.

💻 Projects You’ll Actually Use
Spectral Hacker
Educational spectroscopy tool built with Python. Extracts gas compositions from space and star images by analyzing RGB spectra — ideal for hobbyists, students, educators, and science enthusiasts.

Movie_Game
A FastAPI-powered movie simulation game where producers, actors, and scandals shape each film's success.
